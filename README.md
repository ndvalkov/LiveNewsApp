# News Articles Application

## Description

You are given the task to create an application that displays news articles to the user. The application should have the following functionality:

- **Retrieve Live News Articles**: The application should retrieve live news articles from the Web.
- **Visualize Articles**: The application needs to visualize the retrieved articles so that the user can read them.
- **Search Functionality**: The user should be able to search for news by a given keyword or phrase.
- **Save Articles**: The user should be able to save articles for reading at a later time.
- **Sort Articles**: The user should be able to sort the articles by date published, relevance to the search keyword, and popularity of the source.

## Task Requirements

1. **Platform**: Create an application for Android or iOS. You can use any language such as Kotlin or Swift. You are allowed to use the React Native Framework.
2. **Networking**: Select and use a library to handle the networking part of the assignment.
3. **API**: The application needs to use the [News API](https://newsapi.org/).
4. **Asynchronous Loading**:
    - Articles need to be loaded asynchronously.
    - The application needs to make use of paging when visualizing the articles.
5. **Image Loading**: Article preview images need to be loaded asynchronously.
6. **Adaptive UI**: Creating an adaptive UI for the application is considered a big advantage.
7. **Repository**:
    - The code must be hosted on GitHub, Bitbucket, or any other public or private repository.
    - If a private repository is used, then access to the repository needs to be provided.
    - The code base should include a README file with instructions on how to test the application.
    - It is considered bad practice if you make a single commit with the entire code base. Try to make regular commits with small increments in the functionality of the application.
8. **UI Styling**: You can use any kind of styling for the application UI. Creating a cohesive design is considered a plus.

## Submission

Please notify us when you are ready with the assignment. We expect to receive an email with a link to the repository that was used along with the access details so that we can review your work.
